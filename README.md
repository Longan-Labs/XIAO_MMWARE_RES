The Human Detection Sensor Kit is more than just a hardware bundle; it's a comprehensive solution for human detection that integrates a variety of advanced technologies and modules. At the heart of this kit are three core components: a 24GHz mmWave Sensor, a XIAO ESP32C3 microcontroller board, and a set of Grove system interfaces. Together, these elements form a highly flexible and scalable platform designed to meet a diverse range of human detection needs.

In terms of functionality, the 24GHz mmWave Sensor serves as the "eyes" of the kit, capable of accurately detecting human presence within a certain range. This feature makes it highly applicable in a variety of scenarios, including but not limited to home security, commercial access control, and health monitoring. The XIAO ESP32C3, on the other hand, acts as the "brain" of the kit. Not only does it offer robust data processing capabilities, but it also supports WiFi and Bluetooth communications, allowing users to easily transmit detection data to other devices or the cloud.

The WiFi capabilities of the XIAO ESP32C3 deserve special mention. Beyond basic data transmission, it supports complex interactions with other IoT devices or services through protocols like MQTT and HTTP. This means you can seamlessly integrate this kit into your existing smart home or enterprise systems for more advanced automation and data analytics.

The inclusion of the Grove system further amplifies the kit's scalability. With simple plug-and-play actions, you can add more Grove modules, such as temperature sensors, cameras, or sound sensors, to achieve more personalized functionalities.

In summary, whether you're a DIY enthusiast, a business in need of a customized solution, or an educational institution focused on research and teaching, the Human Detection Sensor Kit offers a comprehensive, efficient, and user-friendly solution for human detection.

//old earthquake data
float oldSI = 0;
float oldPGA = 0;

//flag variables to handle collapse/shutoff only one time during an earthquake
bool shutoffHandled = false;
bool collapseHandled = false;

//function to handle collapse event

}

void setup()
{
    // Open serial communications and wait for port to open:
    Serial.begin(9600);
    while (!Serial)
    {
        ; // wait for serial port to connect. Needed for native USB port only
    }

    Serial.print("Starting D7S communications (it may take some time)...");
    //start D7S connection
    D7S.begin();
    //wait until the D7S is ready
    while (!D7S.isReady())
    {
        Serial.print(".");
        delay(500);
    }
    Serial.println("STARTED");

    //setting the D7S to switch the axis at inizialization time
    Serial.println("Setting D7S sensor to switch axis at inizialization time.");
    D7S.setAxis(SWITCH_AT_INSTALLATION);

    Serial.println("Initializing the D7S sensor in 2 seconds. Please keep it steady during the initializing process.");
    delay(2000);
    Serial.print("Initializing...");
    //start the initial installation procedure
    D7S.initialize();
    //wait until the D7S is ready (the initializing process is ended)
    while (!D7S.isReady())
    {
        Serial.print(".");
        delay(500);
    }
    Serial.println("INITIALIZED!");

    //check if there there was a collapse (if this is the first time the D7S is put in place the installation data may be wrong)
    if (D7S.isInCollapse())
    {
        handleCollapse();
    }

    //reset the events shutoff/collapse memorized into the D7S
    D7S.resetEvents();

    Serial.println("\nListening for earthquakes!");
}

void loop()
{

    //checking if there is an earthquake occuring right now
    if (D7S.isEarthquakeOccuring())
    {

        //check if the shutoff event has been handled and if the shutoff condition is met
        //the call of D7S.isInShutoff() is executed after to prevent useless I2C call
        if (!collapseHandled && D7S.isInCollapse())
        {
            handleCollapse();
            collapseHandled = true;
        }

        //print information about the current earthquake
        float currentSI = D7S.getInstantaneusSI();
        float currentPGA = D7S.getInstantaneusPGA();

        if (currentSI > oldSI || currentPGA > oldPGA)
        {
            //getting instantaneus SI
            Serial.print("\tInstantaneus SI: ");
            Serial.print(currentSI);
            Serial.println(" [m/s]");

            //getting instantaneus PGA
            Serial.print("\tInstantaneus PGA (Peak Ground Acceleration): ");
            Serial.print(currentPGA);
            Serial.println(" [m/s^2]\n");

            //save the current data
            oldSI = currentSI;
            oldPGA = currentPGA;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        //reset the old earthquake data
        oldPGA = 0;
        oldSI = 0;
        //reset the flag of the handled events
        shutoffHandled = false;
        collapseHandled = false;
        //reset D7S events
        D7S.resetEvents();
